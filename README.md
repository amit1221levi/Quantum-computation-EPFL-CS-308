# Summary

The course introduces teh paradigm of quantum computation in an axiomatic way. We introduce the notion of quantum bit, gates, circuits and we treat the most important quantum algorithms. We also touch upon error correcting codes. This course is independent of COM-309.

- Quantum bits, Hilbert space of N qubits, Unitary transformations, measurement postulate. 
- Quantum circuit model, universal sets of gates.
- Deutsch and Josza problem.
  
# Basic algorithms
- Hidden sub-group problem and Simon's algorithm
- Mathematical parenthesis: factoring integers and period of arithmetic functions. Notions on continued fraction expansions.
- Quantum Fourier transform and the period fincding algorithm
- Shor's factoring algorithm.

# Error correcting codes
- Models of noise and errors.
- Shor and Steane error correcting codes.
- Stabilizer codes.
- Calderbank-Shor-Steane construction.

- Keywords

Quantum computation, quantum circuits, universal gates, quantum Fourier transform, Simon algorithm, Shor algorithm, Grover algorithm, entanglement, quantum error correction.
